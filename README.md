# Juniors in Berlin
This repository is a starting point to collect information about companies in Berlin **supporting junior developers**.  
Moreover it collects offers for free positions for interns and juniors.  
It also aims to create guidelines for teaching juniors in your company.

The idea for the repo resulted from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bitboxer/status/558921160562597890) from Bodo:
> Does someone have a list of companies in Berlin offering internships or hire junior developers? Want to talk how you guide and teach them.  

We can create an issues and discuss in order to create a guideline of how to teach juniors.

If you feel like [turning these information into an app](https://twitter.com/sferik/status/558979272816091136) with your learners group please feel more than welcome to do so!

Want to add your company? Talk to me `@malweene` or Bodo`@bitboxer` or create a PR.  
PRs for the README welcome as well.  

###Companies with open junior positions:

###Companies already supporting juniors:
Companies that hired and promoted juniors by improving their knowledge.  
For what that means in detail we created this repo and would like to hear your opinion in the issues.
