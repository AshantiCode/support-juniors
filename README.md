# Juniors in Berlin
This repository is a starting point to collect information about companies in Berlin **supporting junior developers**.  
Moreover it collects offers for free positions for interns and juniors.  
It also aims to create guidelines for teaching juniors in your company.

The idea for the repo resulted from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bitboxer/status/558921160562597890) from Bodo:
> Does someone have a list of companies in Berlin offering internships or hire junior developers? Want to talk how you guide and teach them.  

We can create an issues and discuss in order to create a guideline of how to teach juniors.

Want to add your company? Create a PR or talk to Bodo`@bitboxer` or Malwine `@malweene`.  
Bodo is a developer at bitcrowd and is currently preparing their Junior Developer Curriculum.
Malwine works as a junior at Dawanda. Both want to encourage companies to hire and support juniors.

###Companies with open junior positions:
Companies that want to hire juniors in the future.   
[ Insert your company here!! ]

###Companies already supporting juniors:
Companies that hired and promoted juniors by improving their knowledge.  
For what that means in detail we created this repo and would like to hear your opinion in the issues.
